      <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> Welcome! I'm Dr. Yu-Chen Yen, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Molecular Biosciences at the University of South Florida. I received my bachelor's degree from National Yang-Ming University and a master's degree from National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan.
       
During my Ph.D. training at Purdue University, I became fascinated by the beauty of protein crystals and the ability to visualize proteins to understand how they function. I trained in X-ray crystallography in Dr. Andrew Mesecar’s lab, where I focused on structure-based drug design targeting the BACE (β-site APP cleaving enzyme) protein family.

After earning my Ph.D., I continued my research as a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. John Tesmer at Purdue University, investigating the molecular mechanisms of proteins involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Before joining USF, I gained valuable industry experience at Helix Biostructures. I launched my lab at the University of South Florida in August 2025, where we continue to explore GPCR signaling using structural biology approaches.

    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em"> The amyloid hypothesis—suggesting that the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides is a central driver of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—has long shaped the direction of AD drug discovery. While recent progress, including the FDA approval of anti-amyloid plaque antibodies by Biogen and Eli Lilly, represents a significant milestone, these therapies are not without limitations. Issues such as adverse side effects, delivery challenges, and limited efficacy highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies that target upstream regulators of Aβ production.
Aβ peptides are produced through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Emerging evidence points to G protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) as a key modulator of γ-secretase activity, enhancing Aβ production via its interaction with β-arrestins. Additionally, APH-1, a component of the γ-secretase complex, has been shown to interact directly with β-arrestins, further influencing γ-secretase function.
Our lab focuses on elucidating how β-arrestins regulate γ-secretase activity through their interactions with GPR3 and APH-1. To achieve this, we utilize structural biology techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, along with biophysical methods, to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms. By gaining deeper insight into these regulatory pathways, we aim to identify new molecular targets and ultimately contribute to the development of more effective, small-molecule-based therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.<p>
